## Hi there, fellow coder! 🌍👨‍💻

Welcome to my GitHub profile, where code, creativity, and research converge. 🚀🔬💡

### About Me 🤓
I'm **Borna Barahimi**, a **Machine Learning Researcher & Engineer** with over four years of experience spanning academia and industry. Currently, I work as an **Algorithm Designer at Cognitive Systems Corp.**, where I develop representation learning solutions for motion sequential data in WiFi sensing applications. 

I recently graduated with an **M.Sc. in Computer Science from York University (2024)** with an **A+ GPA**, where I was a **Research Assistant at NGWN Research Lab**, supervised by **Dr. Hina Tabassum**. My research focused on **WiFi sensing, self-supervised learning, and lightweight compression networks**.

### Research & Work Experience 🛠️
- **Algorithm Designer (ML Research Intern) at Cognitive Systems Corp.**
  - Working on **unsupervised learning, quantization, and time-series analysis** for **WiFi sensing applications**.
  - Developing a **unified notion of sensing** in WiFi-motion time-series data for IoT applications.
  - Implementing self-supervised learning methods like **correlation reconstruction and VQ-VAE**.

- **Research Assistant at York University (2022 - 2024)**
  - Led research on **WiFi sensing using self-supervised learning and lightweight compression**.
  - Developed a novel **self-supervised framework for human activity recognition (HAR) with WiFi signals**.
  - Designed a **CSI compression model (RSCNet)** for cloud-based sensing, reducing edge computation by **99%**.
  - Peer-reviewed for top journals including **NeurIPS, IEEE TCOM, IEEE Communications Letters**.
  - **Nominated for the Best Thesis Award** at York University.

- **Research Assistant at University of Tehran (2021 - 2022)**
  - Worked on **semi-supervised learning for Parkinson’s disease detection** using online handwriting data.

- **Fullstack Developer at VClinic (2019 - 2021)**
  - Migrated a legacy healthcare system from **Ruby on Rails to a modern microservice architecture**.
  - Developed **appointment scheduling, virtual visits, and electronic health records (EHR)** solutions.

### Research Interests 🔍
I specialize in **representation learning** frameworks that generalize across tasks **without supervised signals**. My work primarily focuses on:
- **Self-supervised learning** for low-labeled data and out-of-distribution detection.
- Machine learning applications for **time-series analysis**
